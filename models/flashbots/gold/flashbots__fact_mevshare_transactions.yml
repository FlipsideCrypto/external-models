      This table records all the landed backrun transactions on MEV-share, and its original user transaction that is being backrun, as well as the refund transaction where block builder send searcher's refund back to originating user. 
      These 3 transactions are settled in a bundle with the order of `(user_tx, backrun_tx, refund_tx)`.
